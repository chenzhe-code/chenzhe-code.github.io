   Research group proposed a confidence-guided roadside tree extraction algorithm. Based on this algorithm, I further calculate the 3D parameters of roadside trees such as the crown volume, DBH and height, etc. The method has been integrated into Point2Model, a point cloud intelligent processing software.
