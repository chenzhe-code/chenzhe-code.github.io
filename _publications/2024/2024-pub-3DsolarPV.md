   This study proposes a framework for estimating the solar PV potential of city-level building surfaces without human annotation and data acquisition costs. Buildings are extracted from Google satellite images through multi-space joint optimization domain adaptation network, and LoD1 models are generated by combining global DSM with building footprints. The framework was verified by taking Wuhan city as an example..
