  This study introduces a superpoint-assisted Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) for point cloud semantic segmentation without requiring additional training data. For a given scene, the proposed method uses point clouds, associated images, and image pseudo-semantic labels as inputs to achieve pointwise semantic segmentation.
