  We introduce WHU-Synthetic, a large-scale 3D synthetic perception dataset designed for multi-task learning, from the initial data augmentation, through scene understanding , to macro-level tasks. Besides, we implement several novel settings, making it possible to realize certain ideas that are difficult to achieve in real-world scenarios, such as sampling on city-level models, providing point clouds with different densities, and simulating temporal changes.
